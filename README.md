# Using Smart Contracts for Agile Projects

This project presents a smart contract based
approach that tries to minimize the challenges that are currently
faced by the Agile software development model. In our approach,
we try to automatize the development process by using the smart
contracts as a tool to verify the developed features via acceptance
test cases. In our solution, the role of the Product Owner to
verify the correctness of the features and tasks is passed on
to the smart contracts which immediately gives the outcome
when conditions are satisfied. This further helps to increase the
transparency and collaboration amongst the team along with
keeping a complete track on all the development records.
